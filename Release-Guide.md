Release guide for kRPC
======================

This document details the steps necessary to make a release of kRPC.

1. The repository should be clean from changes. Also run a `bazel clean --expunge`.
1. Bump the kRPC version number in `config.bzl` and commit the file.
1. Make an annotated tag for the new version (using `git tag -a vx.x.x) and move the latest-version
   tag to this commit.
1. Run `tools/build-against-all-versions.sh` to check that the mod at least builds against all
   supported versions of KSP.
1. Build kRPC and run all of the tests locally to check that they pass using
   `bazel build //... && bazel test //:test`
1. Push the vx.x.x commit and tag to the main branch on GitHub using `git push && git push --tags`
1. Wait for the CI workflow to pass.
