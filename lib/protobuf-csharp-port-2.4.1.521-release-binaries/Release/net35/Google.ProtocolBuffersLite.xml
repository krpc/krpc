            Non-generic interface for all members whose signatures don't require knowledge of
            the type being built. The generic interface extends this one. Some methods return
            either an IBuilder or an IMessage; in these cases the generic interface redeclares
            the same method with a type-specific signature. Implementations are encouraged to
            use explicit interface implemenation for the non-generic form. This mirrors
            how IEnumerable and IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; work.

            Protocol Buffers are not self-delimiting. Therefore, if you write
            any more data to the stream after the message, you must somehow ensure
            that the parser on the receiving end does not interpret this as being
            part of the protocol message. One way of doing this is by writing the size
            of the message before the data, then making sure you limit the input to
            that size when receiving the data. Alternatively, use WriteDelimitedTo(Stream).

            This class contains two kinds of methods:  methods that write specific
            protocol message constructs and field types (e.g. WriteTag and
            WriteInt32) and methods that write low-level values (e.g.
            WriteRawVarint32 and WriteRawBytes).  If you are writing encoded protocol
            messages, you should use the former methods, but if you are writing some
            other format of your own design, use the latter. The names of the former
            methods are taken from the protocol buffer type names, not .NET types.
            (Hence WriteFloat instead of WriteSingle, and WriteBool instead of WriteBoolean.)

            A class which represents an arbitrary set of fields of some message type.
            This is used to implement DynamicMessage, and also to represent extensions
            in GeneratedMessage. This class is internal, since outside users should probably
            be using DynamicMessage.
            
            As in the Java implementation, this class goes against the rest of the framework
            in terms of mutability. Instead of having a mutable Builder class and an immutable
            FieldSet class, FieldSet just has a MakeImmutable() method. This is safe so long as
            all callers are careful not to let a mutable FieldSet escape into the open. This would
            be impossible to guarantee if this were a public class, of course.

            with IList[object], regardless of the type of the repeated item.</item>
            </list>
            This method returns null if the field is a singular message type
            and is not set; in this case it is up to the caller to fetch the 
            message's default instance. For repeated fields of message types, 
            an empty collection is returned. For repeated fields of non-message
            types, null is returned.
            <para/>
            When setting this property, any list values are copied, and each element is checked

            <remarks>
            This class contains two kinds of methods:  methods that read specific
            protocol message constructs and field types (e.g. ReadTag and
            ReadInt32) and methods that read low-level values (e.g.
            ReadRawVarint32 and ReadRawBytes).  If you are reading encoded protocol
            messages, you should use the former methods, but if you are reading some
            other format of your own design, use the latter. The names of the former
            methods are taken from the protocol buffer type names, not .NET types.
            (Hence ReadFloat instead of ReadSingle, and ReadBool instead of ReadBoolean.)

            In order to prevent malicious messages from exhausting memory or

            The default limit is 64MB.  You should set this limit as small

            size limits only apply when reading from an InputStream, not

            If you want to read several messages from a single CodedInputStream, you

             A table of known extensions, searchable by name or field number.  When
             parsing a protocol message that might have extensions, you must provide
             an <see cref="T:Google.ProtocolBuffers.ExtensionRegistry"/> in which you have registered any extensions
             that you want to be able to parse.  Otherwise, those extensions will just
             be treated like unknown fields.
             </summary>
             <example>
             For example, if you had the <c>.proto</c> file:
             <code>
             option java_class = "MyProto";
            
             message Foo {

             }
             </code>
            
             Then you might write code like:
            
             <code>
             extensionRegistry registry = extensionRegistry.CreateInstance();
             registry.Add(MyProto.Bar);
             MyProto.Foo message = MyProto.Foo.ParseFrom(input, registry);
             </code>
             </example>
            
             <remarks>
             <para>You might wonder why this is necessary. Two alternatives might come to
             mind. First, you might imagine a system where generated extensions are
             automatically registered when their containing classes are loaded. This
             is a popular technique, but is bad design; among other things, it creates a
             situation where behavior can change depending on what classes happen to be
             loaded. It also introduces a security vulnerability, because an
             unprivileged class could cause its code to be called unexpectedly from a
             privileged class by registering itself as an extension of the right type.
             </para>
             <para>Another option you might consider is lazy parsing: do not parse an
             extension until it is first requested, at which point the caller must
             provide a type to use. This introduces a different set of problems. First,
             it would require a mutex lock any time an extension was accessed, which
             would be slow. Second, corrupt data would not be detected until first
             access, at which point it would be much harder to deal with it. Third, it
             could violate the expectation that message objects are immutable, since the
             type provided could be any arbitrary message class. An unprivileged user
             could take advantage of this to inject a mutable object into a message
             belonging to privileged code and create mischief.</para>
