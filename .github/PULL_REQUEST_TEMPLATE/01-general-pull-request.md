# Thanks for contributing to kRPC
## 🛰️Follow these Guidelines for Pull Requests

 * Focus on one thing. A pull request should only have code changes that fix/add one
   bug/feature. The exception to this is if there are many small bugs in one part of the code. These
   can be submitted in a single Pull Request.
 * Don’t fix code style in code that are not directly related to changes in your Pull Request. If
   you want to fix the other lines of code, do it in a separate Pull Request.
 * Keep a clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages. This makes the Pull Request
   easier to review. You can use git rebasing to clean up your commit history or bring in more
   recent changes from the main branch.
 * Keep your Pull Request up to date with the main branch. If there are merge conflicts, they will
   need to be resolved before the Pull Request can be merged.
 * Automated tests should pass. It is best to run the tests locally before submitting a Pull
   Requests to check that they are likely to pass.
