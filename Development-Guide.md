# Development Guide

This document explains the structure of the kRPC codebase, how to build it and the various tools.

If you are not already familiar with how kRPC works, it is recommended that you first read the
documentation on the website:

 * [Extending kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/extending.html)
 * [Communication Protocols](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/communication-protocols.html)
 * [Internals of kRPC](https://krpc.github.io/krpc/internals.html)

## Code Structure and Components

kRPC consists of many components, including the server (which runs in the game), service DLLs (which
add RPCs to the server), client libraries for each language (Python, C#, C++, ...), documentation
and various tools (for client developers and kRPC developers).

The codebase is structured as follows:

 * `server/...` - C# implementation of the main server that runs in the game.
 * `service/...` - C# implementations of the various services that run in the game, and add RPCs to
   the server.
 * `lib/...` - symlinks (or copies) of DLLs required to build the C# projects.
 * `client/...` - the client libraries, with one directory for each language.
 * `client/serialio/...` and `client/websockets/...` - tests for the serialio and websockets
   communication protocols.
 * `doc/...` - source code for the documentation, from which the website and pdf are
   built. Includes auto-generate API documentation for all of the client libraries, generated by the
   `docgen` tool (see below).
 * `protobuf/...` - the schema for the protobuf communication protocol.
 * `tools/TestServer/...` - implementation of a standalone C# executable that can be used to run a
   server without needing the run the game. This can be used by client developers to test that the
   client can communicate with the server correctly.
 * `tools/ServiceDefinitions/...` - a C# binary that can be used to generate a service definition
   file (in json format) from a service DLL.
 * `tools/krpctools/...` - a Python package with various tools for client libraries. Includes
   `docgen` for auto-generating client documentation, and `clientgen` for auto-generating client
   stubs.
 * `tools/krpctest/...` - a Python package with various tools for automated integration
   testing of RPCs running in the game.
 * `tools/TestingTools/...` - a service DLL that can be loaded into the game, to add RPCs that can
   be used for automatic testing. For example, adds an RPC that allows you to teleport a vessel into
   orbit. This is used by `krpctest`.
 * `tools/build/...` - scripts for the Bazel build system
 * `tools/docker/...` - scripts to create the `buildenv` docker image

## Compiling

kRPC uses the [Bazel build system](https://bazel.io>). This provides us with fast, repeatable
builds, and support for many languages. (See below for a Bazel cheat sheet.)

Note: we don't currently support building on Windows, although this is something we are working
on. However, you can build the C# projects on Windows. See the section below named "Building the C#
projects using an IDE". You can also build the project using a docker container running on
Windows. See the section below named "Building using Docker".

### Setting up your Environment

The Bazel build scripts will automatically download most of the required dependencies to build the
project, but the following needs to be installed on your system:

 * Bazel
 * C# compiler, runtime and tools (for example [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/))
 * Python 3.7+
 * Autotools
 * LuaRocks
 * Maven
 * pdflatex and svg tools (for building the documentation)

On Ubuntu, these can be installed via apt as follows:
 * First follow the instructions on [Mono's website](http://www.mono-project.com/download) to add
   their apt repository.
 * Then run the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install mono-complete python-is-python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools \
     python3-virtualenv autoconf libtool luarocks maven latexmk texlive-latex-base \
     texlive-latex-recommended texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra \
     tex-gyre libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev librsvg2-bin libenchant-2-2 build-essential make
   ```

You also need to set up the necessary libraries in the `lib` diretory:
 * `lib/ksp` should contain a copy of the game. You can either create this directory, and copy the
   game files into it, or create a symlink to point to an existing copy of the game. For example,
   run the following command from the root of the krpc source to point to KSP installed in the
   default Steam location:
   ```ln -s "$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program" ksp lib/ksp```

You may also need to modify the symlink at `lib/mono-4.5` to point to the correct location of your
Mono installation. On Ubuntu 22.04 with the latest version of Mono, `lib/mono-4.5` should be a
symlink pointing to `/usr/lib/mono/4.5`

### Building using Bazel

To build the kRPC mod release archive, containing the server DLL and service DLLs, run `bazel build
//:krpc`. The resulting archive containing the GameData directory will be created at
`bazel-out/krpc-<version>.zip`

The build scripts define various "targets" that can be used to build different parts of the project,
by running `bazel build <target>` These targets are available:

 * `//server` - builds the server plugin and associated files
 * Client libraries:
   * `//client/csharp`
   * `//client/cpp`
   * `//client/java`
   * `//client/lua`
   * `//client/python`
   * `//client/python:python-base` - builds the python client, without pre-generated stubs
 * Services
   * `//service/SpaceCenter`
   * `//service/Drawing`
   * `//service/UI`
   * `//service/InfernalRobotics`
   * `//service/KerbalAlarmClock`
   * `//service/RemoteTech`
 * Protobuf definitions:
   * `//protobuf:csharp`
   * `//protobuf:cpp`
   * `//protobuf:java`
   * `//protobuf:lua`
   * `//protobuf:python`
 * Documentation:
   * `//doc:html`
   * `//doc:pdf`

### Building the C# projects using an IDE

A C# solution file (`kRPC.sln`) is provided in the root of the project for use with Visual Studio,
MonoDevelop or a similar C# IDE.

Before it can be used, some generated C# source files need to be built using the Bazel build
scripts. This can be done by running `bazel build //:csproj`

Alternatively, if you are unable to run Bazel to build these files (for example on Windows), you can
get a copy of these files from the "genfiles" archive on the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/krpc/krpc/releases). Download the latest `krpc-genfiles-<version>.zip` and
extract the archive over your copy of the source. This should give you a `bazel-bin` and
`bazel-krpc` directory containing all the necessary files.

### Building using Docker

A docker image called `buildenv` is also provided with the necessary build environment already set
up. It can be used to build the entire project.

Pull the image using:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/krpc/buildenv:latest
```

Then run a container using:
```
docker run -it ghcr.io/krpc/buildenv:latest
```

This will drop you into a command line. Next you need to get the KSP DLLs using the following
commands:

```
mkdir ksp
pushd ksp
wget https://github.com/krpc/ksp-lib/raw/main/ksp/ksp-1.12.5.zip
unzip ksp-1.12.5.zip
popd
```

Note: these KSP DLLs are downloaded from the ksp-lib repository. These DLLs have had their
implementation stripped out. This is sufficient to build the code, without needing to publicly
distribute the original KSP DLLs.

You can then clone the repository, set up some symlinks to the libraries, build everything and run
the tests, using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/krpc/krpc.git
cd krpc
ln -s `pwd`/../ksp lib/ksp
ln -s /usr/lib/mono/4.5 lib/mono-4.5
bazel build //...
bazel test //:test
```

## Tools

Included in the project are various tools to aid development.

 * `tools/serve-docs.sh`
   - Running this script build the documentation website, and starts a local webserver. You can use
   this to try out building the documentation and then view it by pointing a web browser at
   `http://localhost:8080`
 * `tools/install.sh`
   - Running this script builds the mod, and the `TestingTools` DLL, and installs them into the
   GameData directory of the copy of KSP in `lib/ksp`.
 * `tools/run-ksp.sh`
   - This script uses `tools/install.sh` to install the mod (as above) and then launches the
   game. It also pipes the game's log output to the terminal for ease of debugging.

## Running the Tests

kRPC contains a suite of tests for the server plugin, services, client libraries and other parts of
the project.

To run the tests, the following dependencies need to be installed. Without them, some of the tests
will fail.

 * Python 3.7+ development files
 * CppCheck
 * socat

To install these dependencies via apt on Ubuntu run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install cppcheck socat
```

The unit tests can be run using: `bazel test //:test`

Note: these tests do not require the game to be running. They test the various components without
using the game. For communication tests, a tool called "TestServer" is used. This runs a version of
the server plugin without needing to launch the game.

kRPC also includes a suite of tests that test interaction with the KSP. This requires the game to be
running. To run these tests:
 * First run `tools/install.sh`
   This script builds kRPC and the `TestingTools` DLL, and installs them into the GameData directory
   of the copy of KSP found at `lib/ksp`.
 * Then run KSP (in `lib/ksp`), or run `tools/run-ksp.sh` to load up the game automatically.
 * When the game loads, `TestingTools` will automatically load up a save game and place you in the
   flight scene.
 * Install the python client package, the krpctest package. This can be done using:
   ```
   bazel build //client/python //tools/krpctest
   pip install --upgrade bazel-bin/client/python/krpc.<version>.zip
   pip install --upgrade bazel-bin/tools/krpctools/krpc-tools.<version>.zip
   ```
   These python packages are also available from the GitHub releases page.
 * Now you are ready to run the tests.

For example, there are python scripts in `service/SpaceCenter/test/...` that can be used to test the
space center service. These tests use the `krpctools` package to automatically load a save game
called `krpctest` and launch a vessel. They then use the python client to communicate with the game,
and test the various RPCs.

## Bazel cheat sheet

Temporary build files are stored in `bazel-krpc` and `bazel-out`.
Build outputs are stored in `bazel-bin` and test logs in `bazel-testlogs`.

Build the entire project:
```
bazel build //...
```

Build a specific "target", for example the python client:
```
bazel build //client/python:python
```

You can also pass options to `bazel build` to change the way it behaves:

 * Pass ``--subcommands`` to see the actual commands that are being run.
 * Pass ``--jobs 1`` to build using a single thread. Defaults to using all threads.

Clean the entire project (but don't delete downloaded dependencies). This deletes the `bazel-*`
directories:
```
bazel clean
```

Clean the entire project (including deleting downloaded dependencies):
```
bazel clean --expunge
```

Download all dependencies. It's no necessary to do this before building, as build will download the
dependencies it needs, but doing this is useful if you want to work offline:
```
bazel fetch //...
```

Run all tests:
```
bazel test //:test
```

Note: `bazel test //...` does not work!

Run a specific test, e.g. the python client tests:
```
bazel test //client/python:test
```

You can also pass options to `bazel test` to change the way it behaves:

 * Pass ``--subcommands`` to see the actual commands that are being run.
 * Pass ``--jobs 1`` to test using a single thread. Defaults to using all threads.
 * By default bazel will cache test results. To force it to always run the tests use
   `--cache_test_results=false`
 * By default bazel will only print out logs for failed tests. To print out all logs use
   ``--test_output=all``
 * To run tests sequentially, and incrementally output logs, use ``--test_output=streamed``
